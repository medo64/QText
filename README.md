## Encryption

All encrypted files are compatible with salted OpenSSL 256-bit AES CBC file
encryption (as defined at http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/enc.html). In order
to decrypt file OpenSSL command line would be:

    openssl aes-256-cbc -d -in file.txt.aes256cbc -out file.txt -k "password"

That means that, even if you stop using this fabulous program, you can always
get to your data. I consider this an important feature.

Downside to using this standard algorithm is that it is rather fast. And fast
is bad when you need to deal with brute force attacks. This encryption is no
worse than what OpenSSL normally does (it is equivalent actually) but beware
that lot of security lies in well chosen password.
